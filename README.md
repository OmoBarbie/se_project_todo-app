# Simple Todo App

Give a brief description of the project here. Feel free to give it a different name.

## Functionality

Give a more detailed explanation of the project and its functionality.
Moved data and configuration objects to constants.js

Create the Todo class. This creates a to-do item with a name (and optionally, a due date) along with the appropriate handlers.

It should accept the following arguments:

data: an object containing the data for an individual to-do item. You can see the shape of this data by referring to the initialTodos array.
selector: a selector string for the corresponding <template> element

## Technology

Createed a new folder called components containing two files: Todo.js and FormValidator.js. We'll describe these components in more detail later.
Also, create a folder called utils that contains one file: constants.js. We’ll explain what to do with this file in a moment.
In index.html, update the <script> tag for index.js to support JavaScript modules. You’ll need to delete its defer attribute and add an appropriate type attribute.
Delete the <script> tag for validate.js.
